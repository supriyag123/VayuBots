1. **Fetch Ideas**: Get up to {num_ideas} new ideas using the 'Fetch New Ideas' tool

2. **Understand Brand**: Use 'Get Client Brand Info' to understand {client_name}'s voice and preferences

3. **Analyze Performance**: Use 'Get Performance History' to see what content works, then use 'Compare Idea to History' to calculate semantic similarity for each idea

4. **Score Each Idea**: Evaluate each idea on:
   - Brand Alignment (35pts)
   - Audience Relevance (25pts)
   - Performance Potential (15pts)
   - Timeliness (15pts)
   - Quality (10pts)

   - Brief Reasoning in the field Curation Notes (1-2 sentences)
   
   CRITICAL: You MUST call the 'Update Idea Score' tool, exactly by that name without adding any character or formatting it

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT RULES:
- You must ONLY call `Get Idea Details` with one of these valid IDs: {ideas_str}.
- ‚ùå Do NOT invent or guess idea IDs.
- If unsure, skip the idea rather than making up an ID.

**MANDATORY PROCESS - FOLLOW EXACTLY) in ORDER:**

1. Get brand guidelines for the client using 'Get Brand Guidelines' tool

2. For EACH idea:
   
   a. STEP A: Use 'Get Idea Details' tool to fetch the full idea
   
   b. STEP B: **Get an image (MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP) using 'Get Post Image' tool:**
      - Pass: idea summary, headline, brand_voice (from step 1), and source_url
      - Tool will try to scrape from source first
      - If no image found, will generate with DALL-E based on brand context
      - Save the returned image_url to use in posts
      
   c. STEP C: Use 'create_post_variants' tool to create 3 variants of the post with different angles:
      - Variant 1: Emotional/storytelling approach
      - Variant 2: Informational/educational approach
      - Variant 3: Urgency/FOMO approach
   
   d. For EACH variant:
      - Use 'Evaluate Post Variant' to get writing quality score
      - Use 'Compare Post to History' to get similarity score
      - Record both scores
   
   e. Choose the variant with highest combined score (60% quality + 40% similarity)
   
   f. CRITICAL: Save the winner using 'Create Social Post' tool:
       - Include ALL parameters: client_id, idea_id, channel, caption, hashtags, cta, image_url, quality_score, similarity_score
       - Use the image_url from step 2b
       - Create for both Facebook and Instagram (2 posts per idea)
       - Wait for confirmation that post was saved successfully
       - If tool returns error, report it immediately
   
      
   g. 
    **CTA and Link Guidelines:**
    - The source_url from the idea is the article/show page that was scraped
    - Use this as the link URL for the post
    - Create a CTA that matches: "Read the full review", "Learn more", "Get details"
    - For ticket sales, note that link goes to the article, not direct ticket purchase

3. Verify each post was saved by checking for post_id in the tool response


### Writing Principles (must follow):
    - **Hook**: Start with emotion, question, or bold statement
    - **Story**: Connect people to the experience or value
    - **Urgency**: Create FOMO when appropriate
    - **Authenticity**: Match the brand voice, never generic
    - **Adaptation**: Adjust tone and style based on client instructions

### Output Requirements:
    
    **Writing rules:**
    - Start with a bold emoji + bold hook line (e.g., "‚ùì **Ready for‚Ä¶**")
    - Then a story paragraph
    - Then urgency (if relevant)
    - If link_url provided, include a clear **CTA** like:  
          "üéüÔ∏è Get your tickets now: <link>"
    - End with hashtags 
    - Separate sections with blank lines (`\\n\\n`)
    - Do NOT output "Hook:", "Story:", etc. labels
    - Use client brand voice
    - Image: From source or AI-generated
    - Post length: 100‚Äì150 words (not just 1‚Äì2 lines)
    - Format: Use short paragraphs (1‚Äì2 sentences each), separated by line breaks
    - Tone: Conversational, warm, and audience-focused



    **Output format requirement:**
    Return exactly this structure:

    {{
      "posts": [
        {{
          "idea_id": "<one of {idea_ids}>",
          "caption": "<full post caption, multi-line, emojis allowed>",
          "hashtags": "#tag1 #tag2 #tag3",
          "cta": "üéüÔ∏è Book now: <URL>",
          "client_id": "{client_id}",
          "quality_score": <float 0-10>
        }},
        ...
      ]
    }}

    Rules:
    - Must be valid JSON only.
    - No markdown, no commentary, no explanation.
    - Every object must have all fields.



### Example Post Structure:
        ‚ùì Hook: Start with a bold emotional question, or interesting announcement
        
        
        üìñ Story: Explain the event or value in 2‚Äì3 sentences  
        
        
        ‚è≥ Urgency or importance: Add limited time / don‚Äôt miss it phrasing if applicable, or why this post is relevant for our audience 
        
        
        üôå CTA: Create a CTA that matches: "Read the full review", "Learn more", "Get details" and add the link 
        
        
        #Ô∏è‚É£ Hashtags
        


**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:**
- You MUST get an image for every post using 'Get Post Image' tool
- You MUST call 'Create Social Post' tool for EVERY post
- You MUST include both quality_score and similarity_score
- You MUST verify each save was successful
- DO NOT just summarize - you must SAVE to Airtable
- If ANY tool call fails, report the error immediately


**VALIDATION:**
Before calling 'Create Social Post', verify you have:
- ‚úì image_url from 'Get Post Image' tool
- ‚úì quality_score from evaluation
- ‚úì similarity_score from comparison
- If missing image_url, GO BACK to Step B

      - Channel (Facebook/Instagram/LinkedIn)
      - Caption
      - Client ID (for auth tokens)

   - If publishing fails, report the error
   - Continue with remaining posts

**CRITICAL:**
- You MUST call 'Publish Post to Platform' for EVERY post
- Do NOT skip this step
- Do NOT assume posts are published
- Do NOT make up results
- ACTUALLY CALL THE TOOL

**Example:**
If you get 1 post from step 1, you MUST make 1 call to 'Publish Post to Platform' in step 2.
If you get 3 posts, you MUST make 3 calls.

**CRITICAL:**
- Only publish posts with Approval Status = "Approved" or "Auto-Approved"
- Only publish if Scheduled At time has passed (or is blank)
- Update Airtable status after each publish
- Never publish the same post twice
